| Question | Answer | Link |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| The shard key must be unique | False | For a sharded collection, only the _id field index and the index on the shard key or a compound index where the shard key is a prefix can be unique [unique-indexes] |
| There must be a Index on the collection that starts with the shard key | **True** | All sharded collections must have an index that supports the shard key; i.e. the index can be an index on the shard key or a compound index where the shard key is a prefix of the index [shard-key-indexes] |
| MongoDB can not enforce unique Indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key Itself, or Indexes preÔ¨Åxed by the shard key | **True** | You cannot shard a collection that has unique indexes on other fields; You cannot create unique indexes on other fields for a sharded collection [unique-indexes] |
| Any update that does not contain the shard key will be sent to all shards | **True** | Updates that affect multiple documents are more efficient in some situations if they have the shard key, but can be broadcast to all shards [shard-write] |
| You can change the shard key on a collection If you desire | False  | Shard Key is Immutable [limits] |
