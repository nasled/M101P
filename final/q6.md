### M101P final question 6

Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last name, first name and student_id, are too slow (we can't do enough of them per second from our program). And while there are many potential application/hardware solutions such as batching, increasing bandwidth (or RAM), etc., which of the following listed options could potentially improve the speed of inserts?
 
Check all that apply.


| Choice | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Add an index on last_name, first_name if one does not already exist. | False. Each index on a collection adds some amount of overhead to the performance of write operations. |
| Remove all indexes from the collection, leaving only the index on _id in place. | **True**.  Each index on a collection adds some amount of overhead to the performance of write operations. |
| Provide a hint to MongoDB that it should not use an index for the inserts. | False. Indexes cannot be temporarily disabled. |
| Set w=0, j=false on writes. | **True**. Disabled acknowledgement removes an overhead and a safety from writes. |
| Build a replica set and insert data into the secondary nodes to free up the primary nodes. | False. Clients cannot write data to secondaries. |
